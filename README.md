# DSA2ReviewWork
All the work for Review Packet 1 is in Template3DEngine.
All parts of Review Packet 1 are included there, as well as Procedural Models and Analytic Models from Review Packet 2.

Also included is my Octree assignment.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The solution is set up to use x86 rather than x64.  If you load the solution in Visual Studio on a laptop, it will probably default to x64, and so some of the linker properties will be all out of whack.  Set the configuration to x86 and it should work just fine.
